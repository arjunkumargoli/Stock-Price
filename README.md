# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the future prices of stocks using historical market data. Machine learning models are trained on past stock prices to forecast future trends.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze historical stock data and build a regression model that predicts the next-day or next-period closing price of a selected stock.
